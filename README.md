### Setup

#### Prerequisites

* Installed Docker (Desktop): https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

#### Steps to Setup Rocket.Chat with RC-Bot "Hubot"

* In root directory of this repository: `docker-compose up -d`
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Setup admin etc.
* Add user "bot", password "botpassword", role "bot"
* Start Spring Application
* Restart docker for bot to log in
* Write in general channel: `@bot whataboutchuck`

## Iterations of Chuck Bot
### Chuck Mocked
This is a simple Java project which mocks the retrieval and the pushing of jokes with in most simple Java with no dependencies.

#### Prerequisites
* Java 11+ SDK

#### Context
This project is the first interation of the Chuck Bot. There should be no dependencies except Java itself.

#### Goals
* Create a Java project structure (packages, classes).
* Run Java applications from an IDE.
* Create Mocks for missing functionality.
* Create Tests (with first TDD iteration).

### Chuck Bot Static Edition
This will be a fully functional Spring Boot Maven project with no UI or administration, but capable of reading from a real Rocket Chat server and pushing (random from a fixed set of jokes) jokes to a specific Channel on demand.

#### Prerequisites
* Java 11+ SDK
* Maven 3+
* Spring Boot 2+

#### Context
In the second iteration the Mock Bot should be replaced by a fully functioning Bot which integrates with Rocket Chat. It should be able to listen to commands and push responses to a Channel.

#### Goals
* Create a fully functional Spring Boot application.
* Create schedulers for scanning the Channels for commands.
* Create a persistent backend with Spring Data JPA for jokes.

### Chuck CRUD Bot with UI
This will be a fully functional Spring Boot Maven project a simple server-side rendered UI for administration of the jokes and capable of reading from a real Rocket Chat server and pushing (random from a fixed set of jokes) jokes to a specific Channel on demand.

#### Prerequisites
* Java 11+ SDK
* Maven 3+
* Spring Boot 2+

#### Context
In the third iteration it should be possible to administrate jokes in a CRUD way by using a web-UI implemented in Spring MVC.

#### Goals
* Create a fully functional Spring Boot MVC application.
* Create a Spring MVC application with administration functionality for jokes.

### Chuck Secure CRUD Bot
Same as CRUD Bot, but with a RBAC (with Spring Security) for joke administration.

#### Context
In the last iteration the administration should be extended to a secure role-based access CRUD with admin and user roles.

#### Goals
* Extend Spring Boot MVC application with Spring Security.
* Understand RBAC for web applications.
